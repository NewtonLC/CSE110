Hello! I'm a third year Math-CS major who went from straight A's to "C's get degrees".

## About Me

I'd consider myself an alright programmer, but I don't have any SE experience, which is why I enrolled in CSE 110.
As a teammate, I am patient and flexible, and I like to maintain steady communication in my team. Though I wanted to gain experience in programming,
I'm really starting to see that SE involves much more, so I'm just looking to fill whatever roles my team will need.

You can find me in the **VGDC** or **CSForEach**, or if you're taking **MATH 103B** with Yunze Lu or **LIHL 118** this quarter. *My discord username is "skit.s"*

I'm not sure how to incorporate ordered and unordered lists in a natural way so here are my favorite conventional ice cream flavors.
1. Cookies and Cream
2. Cookie Dough
3. Cotton Candy

Hobbies:
- Playing video games with friends & family
